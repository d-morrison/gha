"""Pin the gha#580 credential split in claude-code-review.yml.

The model and a writable forge token must not share a job. A prefix deny
list cannot be a security boundary once Bash is granted whole (gha#580,
raised from a review of #578): wrapping a denied command, or writing
through a redirect, both go around it. The close is architectural.

This suite reads the workflow YAML and the attempt composite, and asserts
the facts a future edit could reverse silently:

1. The model job (`claude-review`) grants no forge-write permission
   and no `id-token: write`. Forwarding `github_token` skips the
   App-token exchange; that exchange's DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS are write
   (anthropics/claude-code-action v1.0.196 `src/github/token.ts`,
   measured 2026-08-26), so granting `id-token: write` would let a
   dropped override mint a write token.
2. The posting job (`post-review`) holds `pull-requests: write` and
   `issues: write`, and does not invoke the model.
3. The attempt composite forwards `github_token` to claude-code-action.
4. The inline-comment MCP tool is not in the model job's allowlist,
   because it posts during the model turn.
5. Pack still runs after a failed `resolve-final` (`!cancelled()` plus
   success/failure outcomes) so a no-verdict run still reaches the
   posting job (gha#543).
6. The gha#543 failure notice still posts when the packed artifact is
   missing (`download.outcome != 'success'` on a finished review).
7. Caller grant lists include `actions: read` (a `permissions:` block
   sets unspecified scopes to none; without it `download-artifact` 403s)
   and `checks: read` (the model job's check-run reads 403 without it,
   gha#829), and the model job itself requests `checks: read`.
8. Every `steps.fail-check*.outputs.<name>` the workflow reads is declared
   in run-review-guard/action.yml. A composite's step outputs are
   invisible to its caller unless re-declared, and gha#804's first draft
   read two outputs the guard never exposed: every offline suite stayed
   green while the feature was inert on a live run.

PyYAML is required, same as run-reviewer-allowlist-tests.py.
